# Lab 4 - Spark java, Swagger, REST and Postman

## Experiment 1 - Spark/Java framework and Postman 

 - Cloned the repo
 - Installed postman locally on laptop
 - Used the GET HTTP 
 - Did not get the PUT to work at first. After reading the docs for Postman the put request, this time with a body was sent.
But was not able to verify that it worked. After checking again in Postman the error was found. 
By mistake a POST request was used instead of a PUT.
After changing to a PUT the request was acknowledged and verified to work.   


## Experiment 2 - REST API and TODO
